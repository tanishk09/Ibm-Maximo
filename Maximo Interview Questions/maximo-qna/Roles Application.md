## Interviewer:
**What is the Email Address type role in Maximo?**

## Candidate:
The Email Address type role in Maximo is used to send workflow or system notifications to a specific email address instead of assigning a task to a Maximo user. It is mainly used for communication purposes and does not create a workflow assignment.

---

## Interviewer:
**When we create an Email Address type role in Maximo, why is only the Value field editable while Object, Parameter, Email, and Broadcast fields are read-only?**

## Candidate:
In the Email Address role, only the Value field is editable because the system treats the role as a static email destination, not as a dynamic user resolution role.

## Interviewer:
**What is a Custom Class type role in Maximo?**

## Candidate:
A Custom Class type role in Maximo is a role that uses a custom Java class to dynamically determine which users should receive a workflow assignment or notification. It is used when standard role types cannot handle complex business logic.

## Interviewer:
**A workflow was assigned to one person, but that person left the company. How can this risk be avoided?**

## Candidate:
Use a Person Group role instead of a Person role to avoid dependency on a single user.
